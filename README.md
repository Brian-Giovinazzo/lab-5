# Lab 5 : Client/server network programming

## Student Name: Brian Giovinazzo

Modify the `server.c` file from the network programming episode to satisfy the following 
requirements. Call this modification `server_1.c`:

- `server_1` will no longer require the users to enter the text from the server side. 
- Instead, `server_1` will echo what the client sent in capitalized format. You will have 
to do some digging to find out what extra C functions/libraries are needed. 
- If `client.c` sends the phrase `exit`, both `client` and `server_1` should shutdown properly. 
- Take a screenshot that demonstrates the workflow between `server_1` and `client` in a manner 
similar to the lecture, including the final exit. 


## Submission:

- The README.md file should contain the student's name. 
- The lab repository should contain the followings:
  - The screenshot specified in the task. 
  - Source codes for `server_1.c` and `client.c`.
